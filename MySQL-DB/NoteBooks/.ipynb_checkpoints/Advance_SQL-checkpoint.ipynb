    "### Stored Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "*A stored procedure in MySQL is a **set of SQL statements that can be stored in the database and executed later**.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    Definition: A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that are stored on the database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encapsulation: It encapsulates a series of SQL statements and procedural logic, providing a way to execute multiple commands as a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Execution: Stored procedures are executed on the server, which reduces the amount of data transferred between the client and the server, improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters: Stored procedures can take input parameters and return output parameters, making them flexible for various scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reuse: Once created, stored procedures can be reused by multiple applications or parts of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Security: Stored procedures can help enhance security by allowing controlled access to data. Users can execute a stored procedure without having direct access to the underlying tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modularity: They promote modularity in database development by allowing developers to break down complex tasks into manageable, reusable units.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Transaction Control: Stored procedures can include transaction control statements (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK), allowing for better control over database transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Performance: The precompiled nature of stored procedures can lead to improved performance compared to executing individual SQL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Maintenance: Centralized management of logic within stored procedures simplifies maintenance and updates, as changes can be made in one place.\n",
